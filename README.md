### Development

The app is built using [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue)@[1c165f7](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue/tree/1c165f7c5e56edaf48be0fbb70838a1af26bb015) Documentation about the original structure can be found [here](https://simulatedgreg.gitbooks.io/electron-vue/content/index.html).

#### Build Setup

This project has `node-canvas` as a dependency, which requires additional software to be installed.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
npm run build

```

You can find installation instructions for building `node-canvas` are [here](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas), and special ones for windows [here](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki/Installation---Windows#install-with-chocolatey). 

These instructions may or may not work for you on the first try. If in doubt, delete the `node_modules` directory start a fresh install with `npm install`, and google any error messages. With persistance, you'll get there eventually.

When building on Linux, ensure that `snapcraft` and `snap core` are available and installed (or comment out the `snap` entry in `package.json`).
